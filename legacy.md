###Cartography

Cartography [4] is the study and practice of making maps.It has played an important role in travel and navigation since ancient times.
One of the pioneer cartographers to create the map of the world was Anaximander [2] who made important contributions to the science of
astronomy and geography.

###Democracy

Democracy is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament.[3]
Democracy is sometimes referred to as "rule of the majority".[5]
Democracy can be traced back from the present day to classical Athens and Greeks in the 6th century B.C.[3]

###Pap test

The Papanicolaou test [7] (abbreviated as Pap test, known earlier as Pap smear, cervical smear, or smear test) is a method of cervical
screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb). Abnormal
findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression
 to cervical cancer. The test was invented by, and named for, the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.
The test was invented by and named after the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou, who started his research in 1923.

###Olympic Games

Olympic Games [6] or Olympics is the biggest international sporting events in which athletes from around the world come together to compete in a variety of games.
The ancient Olympic Games were held in Olympia in honour of Zeus.
The five Olympic Rings [9] represent all the major regions of the world (Asia, Africa, Europe, America and Oceania).
Also, the Olympic colours represent the flags of all the nations that compete in the games.
The International Olympic committee sees the Olympic Games as an important means to promote world peace through fair and equal athletic competition.

###The Parthenon
The Parthenon [8] is a former temple on top of the sacred place of the Acropolis, situated at the center of Athens, the capital of Greece.
It is dedicated to the goddess Athena (Modern Greek: "Αθηνά") who is believed to be the city’s patron [8]. It is also estimated that
the Athenians began its construction at 447 BC during an era when the Athenian Empire was very powerful [8].
However, other sources refer to a previous establishment that had already started to be built when it was burned by the Persians at 480 BC,
at the position where the Parthenon was built later on [1]. The Parthenon was finally completed in 438 BC although some minor
decoration changes continued for 6 more years (until 432 BC). It should be mentioned that the Parthenon, which was built by following the standards
of the Doric order, is undoubtedly the most important surviving building of Classical Greece [4].

###Frappe Coffee

Frappe Coffee [10] is an iced coffee drink with foam made by instant coffee and is usually served with milk.
It was invented accidentally in 1957 in Thessaloniki,Greece by a Greek Nescafe representative and has become the most popular coffee drink for Greeks and tourists as well.
The word frappe comes from French and it means to hit which is also the cause for the foam.

###The Delphic maxims

Are a set of 147 aphorisms inscribed at Delphi. Originally, they were said to have been given by the Greek god Apollo's Oracle at Delphi and were therefore attributed to Apollo himself. The 5th century scholar Stobaeus later attributed them to the Seven Sages of Greece. Contemporary scholars, however, hold that their original authorship is uncertain and that "most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages." Perhaps the most famous of these maxims is 'know thyself', which was carved into the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The specific order and wording of each maxim varies between different versions (and translations) of the text.[11]

Some of them are:

* Respect your parents
* Know what you have learned
* Be/Know yourself
* If you are a stranger act like one
* Control yourself
* Help your friends
* Love friendship
* Listen to everyone

###The Democratisation of Literacy

The Greeks did not just invent an alphabet. They succeeded in making literacy available to the masses. Greek letters, being mapped carefully and extensibly to sounds, were easy to learn. Therefore, even children could learn to read while learning the sounds of the oral vocabulary.

Moreover, by stripping letters off their meaning, reading them lost its psychology influencing ability. Reading it, imposed no references to the properties of the letter. Thus writting became for the first time an instrument of thought.

Additionally, by organising schools to instruct reading at an elementary level, it became a reflex and a common skill that was later spread to an even bigger population.

###Antikythera mechanism

The Antikythera mechanism is an ancient analogue computer and orrery used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes, as well as the Olympiads, the cycles of the ancient Olympic Games.

The Antikythera mechanism was discovered in 45 metres (148 ft) of water in the Antikythera shipwreck off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of Antikythera. The wreck was found in April 1900 by a group of Greek sponge divers, who retrieved numerous artefacts, including bronze and marble statues,

pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism. All were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. Merely a lump of corroded bronze and wood at the time, the mechanism went unnoticed for two years while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious statues

###Theatre

Theatre [14] is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.

The city-state of Athens is where western theatre originated.[4] It was part of a broader culture of theatricality and performance in classical Greece that included festivals, religious rituals, politics, law, athletics and gymnastics, music, poetry, weddings, funerals, and symposia.

###Mathematics

The Greeks produced great advancements in mathematics [15] which are still used today. Euclid was known for the basic rules and terms of geometry. Pythagoras was famous for his theorem A2 +B2 = C2 for a right triangle. Pythagoras also came up with the value of pie to calculate the circumference of a circle.
Archimedes discovered the physical law of displacement. The law of displacement is when an object moves the same volume of water as the object which is placed in it. Archimedes also used levers and pulleys to move heavy objects. He once launched a fully loaded ship all by himself. Archimedes also invented the Archimedes screw, which raises water up from rivers for the irrigation of fields. In addition to discoveries in math and physics, he also invented weapons to help the Greeks fight off Roman invasion. One of those weapons was the catapult. In 21 B.C. the Romans captured his city and killed him.

###Archimedes' Principle

In On Floating Bodies, Archimedes suggested that (c. 250 BC):

    Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

Practically, Archimedes' principle allows the buoyancy of an object partially or fully immersed in a liquid to be calculated. The downward force on the object is simply its weight. The upward, or buoyant, force on the object is that stated by Archimedes' principle, above. Thus, the net upward force on the object is the difference between the buoyant force and its weight. If this net force is positive, the object rises; if negative, the object sinks; and if zero, the object is neutrally buoyant - that is, it remains in place without either rising or sinking. In simple words, Archimedes' principle states that, when a body is partially or completely immersed in a fluid, it experiences an apparent loss in weight that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the immersed part of the body.

###Astronomy

The development of astronomy [17] by the Greek and Hellenistic astronomers is considered by historians to be a major phase in the history of astronomy. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. Most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy, as are the names of many stars, asteroids, and planets. It was influenced by Egyptian and especially Babylonian astronomy; in turn, it influenced Indian, Arabic-Islamic and Western European astronomy.

###Marathon

The marathon[18] is a long-distance running race with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26.219 miles, or 26 miles 385 yards), usually run as a road race. The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides (more correctly, Philippides), a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who reported the victory.

The name Marathon comes from the legend of Philippides or Pheidippides, the Greek messenger. The legend states that he was sent from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon (in which he had just fought), which took place in August or September, 490 BC. It is said that he ran the entire distance without stopping and burst into the assembly, exclaiming νενικήκαμεν (nenikēkamen, "we have won!"), before collapsing and dying.

The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the distance did not become standardized until 1921. More than 500 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.
