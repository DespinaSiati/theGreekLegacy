###Pap test

The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, known earlier as Pap smear, cervical smear, or smear test) is a method of cervical 
screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb). Abnormal 
findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression
 to cervical cancer. The test was invented by, and named for, the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.

###The Parthenon
The Parthenon [8] is a former temple on top of the sacred place of the Acropolis, situated at the center of Athens, the capital of Greece. 
It is dedicated to the goddess Athena (Modern Greek: "Αθηνά") who is believed to be the city’s patron [8]. It is also estimated that 
the Athenians began its construction at 447 BC during an era when the Athenian Empire was very powerful [8]. 
However, other sources refer to a previous establishment that had already started to be built when it was burned by the Persians at 480 BC, 
at the position where the Parthenon was built later on [1]. The Parthenon was finally completed in 438 BC although some minor 
decoration changes continued for 6 more years (until 432 BC). It should be mentioned that the Parthenon, which was built by following the standards 
of the Doric order, is undoubtedly the most important surviving building of Classical Greece [4].
